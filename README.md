-The project is being prepared to understand whether the credit card customer will make a payment default in the next month or not based on a number of features.

-We used an anonymized dataset of Taiwanese credit card holders from October 2006 (Chou, 2006). This dataset was made available to the public and posted on the UC Irvine Machine     Learning Repository website. The dataset contains:
-30,000 observations. Each of these observations corresponds to an individual credit cardholder.
-Using SelectKbest to select the best features to optimize our model prediction
-List of model used: KNN with score of 0.81 Descision Tree 0.82 ANN 0.77 XGboost is the model who have the best score 0.92
